Sets are a mutable collection of distinct (unique) immutable values that are unordered. Sets are another standard Python data type that also store values. In this tutorial we will learn about Python sets: what they are, how to create them, when to use them, built-in functions, and their relationship to set theory operations. 

### Key takeaways: 
This tutorial will introduce you a few topics about Python sets and set theory:


How to initialize empty sets and sets with values.
How to add and remove values from sets
How to use efficiently use sets for tasks such as membership tests and removing duplicate values from a list.
How to perform common set operations like unions, intersections, difference, and symmetric difference.
